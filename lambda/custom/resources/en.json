Or you can bet on groups of adjacent numbers such as 1 and 2; or 5, 6, 8, and 9. You can also place bets on a row or double row by calling out three or six numbers, such as \"bet on 7, 8, and 9.\" Betting on two numbers pays 17 to 1, three numbers 11 to 1, four numbers 8 to 1, and six numbers 5 to 1.\nIf you wish to change between a single zero and double zero wheel, you can say \"Change the wheel to an American wheel\" or \"Change the wheel to a European wheel.\" An American wheel has two zeroes, while a European wheel cuts the house advantage in half by only having a single wheel. Your high score and ranking are maintained separately between these two types of wheels.\nYou earn achievement points as you play which is how the high score board is determined.
